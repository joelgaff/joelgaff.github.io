Have to ever walked up to a Starbucks hoping to grab a quick cup of coffee, only to find a long line waiting for you?

Pro tip: order from the mobile app.

When you order from the mobile app, your order prints out from a little receipt printer behind the counter and someone will usually pull the order right off the printer and start making it. After you order, just go stand by the pick up end of the counter and wait as you watch everyone else stand in line.

This morning I placed an order when I was right outside my the location I was at, and walked in to find them at there we're about seven or eight people in line. I walked down the to pick up counter and saw someone already making my drinks. I was out of there less than two minutes later. ☕️
