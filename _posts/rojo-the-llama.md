If you're in the Portland area, you may have heard of [Rojo The Llama](https://www.instagram.com/rojothellama/?hl=en). He's the coolest llama you'll ever meet. I got to meet him today.

Unfortunately, Rojo is retiring after 17 years as a therapy llama, so if you haven't already met him, now is the time.
