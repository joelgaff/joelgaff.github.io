Some of the best advice I've ever received was from my dad. There are several little mantras that he passed along to me that I think about on a regular basis, and have helped shape me into the person I am today.

I am pretty proud of the successes I've had in life so far, and many of those successes were not easy tasks.  Becoming an Eagle Scout, winning a class A high school state championship in the 300m hurdles, and starting a small business are just a few.

My dad always told me, "you can do anything if you put your mind to it." I've believed this and lived this my whole life, and hope to instill it in my daughters some day.
