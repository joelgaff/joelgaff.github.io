No one likes to be wrong. Sometimes (often times?) even when we know we're wrong, we won't admit it, instead we get defensive and try to come up with some sort of story about how we're correct.  I've learned that in most cases this strategy doesn't work.  I mean, when you're wrong, and you know you're wrong, just admit it.  It will often times end arguments even before they begin.

I first started thinking about this amazing idea of admitting I'm wrong from the book [How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Win_Friends_and_Influence_People).  This book is over 80 years old, but still has so many practical and applicable ideas in it.  I highly recommend this book.  Read it, refer back to it, keep it close at hand until you've mastered the very simple techniques it presents.
