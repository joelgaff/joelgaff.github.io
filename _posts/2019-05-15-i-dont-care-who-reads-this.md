As a writer it's pretty much expected that someone will read what you're writing. But when you write, how much does the reader affect what you write? Do you say certain things or not say others based on who you think (or know) will read your writing? Do you ask yourself , "what will so-and-so think about what I'm writing here?"

I guess the answer to that can depend on what kind of writing you're doing. But when I write I try to keep my reader out of my writing so I can write freely and without reservation.

\*95% true.
