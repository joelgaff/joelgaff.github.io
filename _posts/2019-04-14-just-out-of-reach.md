One of the best tactics I've employed in my quest to get up earlier and be more productive in the morning is a simple one: I place my phone about six feet away from the bed on the floor.  In the morning when my alarm goes off, I'd better get up quickly to turn it off, as to not wake up my wife (too much at least).

The hardest part in doing this isn't actually getting out of bed to turn off the alarm, but rather putting the phone down there when I go to bed the night before.  I'm typically a heavy phone user as I lay in bed at night, but putting the phone down on the floor before I get into bed has been a bonus to help get me to sleep better.
