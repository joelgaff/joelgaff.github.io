My blog is pretty young as I write this.  I've written several posts over the past several years, just like most people who want to start a blog. Recently I've committed to creating a positive writing habit, where I write at least a little something every day.  I'm almost a month in, and have just about 30 posts on the site now.

Right now I know no one is reading. I know it because my website stats tell me so.  I know this because, well, why would someone be here reading this?  I'm not known as a writer.  I'm not known as a real expert in anything.  I don't syndicate my posts anywhere.

And I'm cool with the fact that no one is reading.  In fact I'm kind of glad no one is reading.  My writing is still rough.  I don't spend hours crafting my posts. But I'm posting. Every. Day.

**Done is better than perfect.**

Hopefully the content gets better over time, but it definitely won't get better if there _is no_ content. So I'll keep writing.
