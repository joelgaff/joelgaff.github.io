One one of my favorite things about being a race director is that no two days are ever the same. There are definitely tasks I do more often, such as writing [manuals](http://joelgaff.com/blog/race-manuals), but on a given day I may be writing, designing a venue layout in 3D modeling software, testing RFID timing hardware, visiting a race site, or managing social media and emails.

This along with a flexible work schedule make me a happy dude.
