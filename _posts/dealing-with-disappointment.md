I was scheduled to travel to [Ironman 70.3 St. George](http://www.ironman.com/triathlon/events/americas/ironman-70.3/st.-george.aspx) in Utah this coming weekend to shadow the race director as part of my training for [Ironman 70.3 Traverse City](http://www.ironman.com/triathlon/events/americas/ironman-70.3/traverse-city.aspx) later this summer.  I was also planning to attend meetings in Traverse City for said race early next week.  It was going to be a seven or eight day trip, and with a premature newborn and recovering wife/mama at home, it was going to be a tough trip to manage.

Ultimately, I had to pull the plug.

I am a person who always follows through on commitments that I make, and this was a very hard pill to swallow.  When I told my boss, he seemed understanding, but understandably a bit frustrated.  I echo that sentiment.  I'm frustrated, and still trying to figure out all the information that I need to pass along to my Ironman colleagues that will be attending the meetings and presenting in my stead. A big part of my job is about building relationships and it's hard to build relationships from 1700 miles away.

But I know it's the right decision to be here at my Portland home, to help my family out during this time. It would be tough to leave my recovering wife, along with our 18 month old and three week old daughter who currently barely sleeps at night.

Sometimes the best decision isn't the one we want to make. Period.
