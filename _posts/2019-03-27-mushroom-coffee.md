Inspired by the [Rich Roll Podcast](https://www.richroll.com/category/podcast/), I ordered some [Four Sigmatic](https://us.foursigmatic.com) mushroom coffee last week. I'm about halfway through the ten pack of packets and I'll write up a more in depth review in a few weeks.

For now I'll say: not as mushroomy as I would have thought. Stand by...
