After my wife and I had our first child it was an adjustment to life with a little one around the house. Our day jobs stayed the same, and just about everything else did too, except for one big change: a kid. We suddenly had to worry about feeding times, diaper changes, nap times, and car seats. And a lot of other things. I realized at that moment that I'd probably never stop worrying about my little girl. Never. And I finally realized why my mom always stayed up until I got home when I went out as a teenager, and why she still calls me if she hasn't heard from me in a few days.

Laura and I did finally adjust to life as parents. And then, when Hazel was only 17 months old, Penelope joined us and the process began again. Except now we had a toddler in the mix, so it wasn't truly starting over, it was more like adding another layer to the complex labyrinth of parenthood.

In a few days Laura will end her maternity leave and will head back to work full time. I'll be at home, working full time, now also taking care of Penelope during the day (Hazel now goes to day care).

It's time to find the new, new normal.
