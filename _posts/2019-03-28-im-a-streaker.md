I'll cut right to the chase: I love a good streak. I \*may\* have run a naked mile in college once, and I have most definitely ridden in the past four [World Naked Bike Rides in Portland](https://pdxwnbr.org/), but I'm not talking about getting naked. I'm talking about doing something - writing a blog post, going for a run, or reading at least one chapter in the book I'm reading - every day for as long as possible.

Knowing I have a streak going is just about all the motivation I need to keep my desired habit up. Right now, for example, it's alert 10:00 pm, and I've been packing moving boxes all day, and I am exhausted. I want nothing more than to go brush my teeth and flop into bed. But, I haven't written my daily blog post yet, and, I have a streak going. It may sound silly, but, here I am, writing away.

Maybe you're not the kind of person that is motivated by streaks, but I'd encourage everyone to at least give it a try.
