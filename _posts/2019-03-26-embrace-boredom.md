Everyone loves doing hard work when it's exciting or fun.  It's when work gets challenging or boring that true professionals stand out.

Reading James Clear talk about this this morning really struck a cord.  I find myself often bored with my day to day work, but I know that I have to stick through the boredom because it's my job.  With running and athletics I also get bored, not only during some long runs and rides themselves, but in larger training blocks where during a whole week I just don't want to get out the door and workout.  Hearing Clear describe how "professionals" are capable at working through boredom because they know that their work won't always be fun, exciting, or glamorous  helped frame this idea in a positive light for me.
