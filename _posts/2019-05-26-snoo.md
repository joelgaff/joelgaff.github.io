Have you ever heard of [this thing](https://www.happiestbaby.com/products/snoo-smart-bassinet)? The Snoo is a rather expensive bassinet that rocks your baby and plays white noise when she starts to cry or get fussy. It seemed like a silly idea to me, until our second child came along, and decided that sleep was an activity she didn't want to partake in.

Our first child slept like a boss from very early on, and still does to this day. But number two, not so much. My wife and I were exhausted and at our limit, when we realized that we could rent this thing for considerably less than the $1,200 purchase price.

So we rented one, and our usually fussy six week old is currently sleeping like a boss herself (I'm writing this in the evening). We'll see how it works in the long run, but at least for tonight, it looks like I'll be getting some sleep.
