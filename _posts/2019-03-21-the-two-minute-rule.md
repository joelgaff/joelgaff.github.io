Iv'e been reading James Clear's [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits) lately, and finding a load of useful info in it. Today's takeaway: the two minute rule.

To help your new, desired habit to stick, start out by just doing two minutes of it. Don't worry about running for 30 minutes, or doing and hour of work. Just get in the habit of doing said task, and do it for just two minutes. Once you're in the habit of doing it for two minutes, it'll be easy to do more later.
