At [Endurance Evolution](https://www.enduranceevolution.com/) we've been using Basecamp for over six years, and I don't know how we would operate today without it.

If you're not familiar, [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/) is an online project management platform. All of our internal, and some of our external communication happens in Basecamp. From to-do lists, to private messages (pings), to group discussions, to file storage, Basecamp is the place.

I could write a super long article here about how Basecamp is so great, but just like LaVar Burton would say, [you don't have to take my word for it](https://youtu.be/l9nFs2PeWw0). Instead check out [how Basecamp works](https://basecamp.com/how-it-works) and see for yourself.

(This was _not_ a sponsored post in any way. We just love Basecamp that much.)
