In today's world you might think that any book title (or any title for that matter) that has "e" in it refers to "electronic". I wouldn't hold it against you if you did here, either, but in the case of [The E-Myth Revisited](https://amzn.to/2M3QkWI) by Michael Gerber, the big E stands for entrepreneur.

In this book Gerber talks in depth about some of the most simple and common mistakes business owners make when building and running a business.

This book has been the single most influential work I've read in the past several years, and it has truly molded the way I now run my business, [Endurance Evolution.](hrtps://enduranceevolution.com)

One of the biggest take away messages I can quickly pass on to you right here is: your business is no good if when you remove yourself from it, it won't function.

Now that's a pretty bold, broad statement, and I won't give you much to back it up here, but rather I'll encourage you to read the book. You'll not only understand what that statement means, but you'll also learn how to avoid some of the most common mistakes when building and running a business, too.
