In 2020 I finally got into a solid habit of reading.  I got a Kindle, which was a game changer for me, and I started listening to audio books while working out.  Both of these new-to-me media helped me go from _maybe_ reading a book or two a year, to 17 books in 2020. 
  
Over the past few months I've been spending a lot of my time building a new online company/shop.  I've spent a lot of time in the evenings on my phone, in bed, "working" on the project. I use the term "working" loosely, because it's hard to say how productive all that time laying in bed, staring at my phone has actually been.  
  
I've also neglected my reading habit for most of the first two months of 2021.  This week, however, I fored myself back into reading, and I realized quickly how all that time spent reading isn't just lost time.   
  
Most of the books I read are non-fiction and many of them are productivity or business related. I went on a Malcom Gladwell kick in late 2020, reading 4-5 of his titles in a row.  I'm learning constantly as I read, and now remembering that this time spent reading is important to keep learning new perspectives and ideas.  
  
When I'm on a solid reading binge, I find myself discovering new ideas from the books, and am able to apply many of this new information quickly to whatever projets I'm working on in my professional life.
