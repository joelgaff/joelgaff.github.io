I've been operating ENDURANCE EVOLUTION for almost 12 years now, and the business has gradually increased over that time. I've achieved some big milestones in the past few years, such as becoming race director for IRONMAMN 70.3 TRAVERSE CITY, achieving nearly 1,000 registrants for the SLEEPING BEAR MARATHON..., and a TIMING SERVICES business that keeps steadily growing.

I've been doing a lot of thinking over the past several months on how I can grow the company in the smartest way possible. I've been able to earn a modest income from all my efforts at the company over the past several years, but I'm still definitely working a lot harder/more than one might expect for the paycheck I earn.

I could dig in and try to get a handful more timing clients and bring in several thousand dollars more in revenue. I could add another race to our lineup. I could do more contract work for other larger events. But, none of these seem like the right answer to how I think I should be scaling, in a smarter way.

I want to know figure out what I can do to leverage my decade of experience, or the connections or skills I have to reap a greater revenue gain than a few thousand dollars. What can I do that will bring in an additional ten or twenty thousand dollars? And in the smartest, most efficient way.

I'v put in years of nose-to-the-grindstone hard work to get to where I am today, but now that I have a larger set of skills and connections, how can I use those more smartly to scale the companies revenue?
