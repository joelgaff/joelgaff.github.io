Things are going to get pretty meta today as I tap out this post about the official WORDPRESS APP \*on\* the Wordpress app on my iPhone.

This website, JOELGAFF.COM is a self hosted Wordpress site, meaning that I've purchased web space via a hosting provider, installed Wordpress, and all other customizations, all on my private web space. This is opposed to a Wordpress hosted website, where essentially Wordpress serves as the web hosting provider.

One advantage of a Wordpress hosted site is that it's very easy to set up (there really isn't much set up), and everything is in one place (hosting and database). Updates happen seamlessly and the hosting is designed specifically for Wordpress sites. With a self hosted site you bathe much more flexibility in terms of where and how you host your site, but you need to know how to do all that stuff. If you're not comfortable installing a database on a web server or loading software into a web directory, then a self hosted site may not be the best option for you.

One cool feature of both types of hosting is the Wordpress app. It's like having a custom app built just for your website.

I love the Wordpress app because it's got a very clean design, has all the great features of the web version, and it really gives you the power to write and post when you're away from your computer.
