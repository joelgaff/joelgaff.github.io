Make videos for discrete functions of the Canon 5D Mk IV. Make a blog post here first, that walks through the feature, then use this post/writing as a loose script for the video. Or vice versa? Either way, make a written post from the video to help add content. Kind of like DC Rainmaker is doing.

Detail every possible function of the camera, big or small. Someone out there will want to know. Make a playlist just for the 5D Mk IV.
