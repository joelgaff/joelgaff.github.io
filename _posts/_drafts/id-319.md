When the wind blows, the leaves get whipped around a lot and moveall over the place.  The branches sway, and flex, but don't move as much, and the trunk only sways very little/when it's really windy.

What metaphor can I make for this to business, life, etc. ?

Inspiration was when I had Pip on my chest for kangaroo time in hte NICU on April 16, 2019, looking out the window at the bamboo trees outside swaying in the wind.
