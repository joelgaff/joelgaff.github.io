I'm finally starting to feel a little settled in in our new home.  The last three months have been a period of unsettledness, non-productivity, and general anxiety and stress.

I bought my first home about ten years ago, when I was a single guy in my late twenties. Selling and buying a home as a single person is a big deal, but add in a spouse and kid, and things get a lot more challenging (I'm sure the same could be said about a lot of things in life). We spent nearly 15 months looking for a new home, and the last three months selling our current home.  It's been a period of missed workouts, comfort eating, and tension in the house.

After just three nights in the new place, I feel peace descending upon our life. The new house is still a mess, and we have a lot of unpacking to do, but knowing that things will get better from here makes things nice.
