There are times in my job as owner and operator of [Endurance Evolution](https://www.enduranceevolution.com/) that I'm not so thrilled with the tasks I have to do. Most of those times are when I'm super tired or stressed. But, I love the life that this job provides me and my family. It's a flexible schedule. I can work from just about anywhere. Two days are never the same. I'm lucky enough to have a job that I love, and a job where I'm pretty much my own boss.

But in those moments when I'm setting up mile marker signs in the pouring rain, I remind myself that I don't have to do this, I get to do this. I get to have a flexible schedule. I get to work where I want. I get to be outside, helping others achieve personal goals. I get to do a lot of cool stuff in my job.
