When I'm feeling particularly stressed out or immersed in a stressful period (read: post child birth) there's nothing better than binging on some Netflix for an hour or two, or watching a movie to disconnect from reality for a little bit. Truly forgetting about all that is stressful in life, albeit for just a handful of minutes, feels great and it helps put the current life situation in perspective.

Sometimes all that's needed to remove some of the stress is to look at the situation from the outside in. And the only way to do that is to break away from the situation via a cheesy rom com or the latest indie documentary.
