For the last 12 years or so [Endurance Evolution](https://enduranceevolution.com) has been a big part of my life. I’ve helped lead the team in planning and producing a handful of running races and triathlons each year, as well as a timing services division that timed 40 or so races each season.

The company was built slowly. We started small and grew organically. We only undertook debt once to buy some timing equipment (a 0% interest loan).

For various reasons, which you can [listen to here,](https://traversecityrun.co/blogs/journal/a-chat-with-michigan-runner-girl) the time was right to let the events and timing services go and grow.

I knew the time was right, but I also knew it may be difficult to let go of something that had been such a big part of my life. It was more that a job, it really felt like an identity. I put my heart, soul, a little blood, and a lot of sweat into everything I did. 

I’m in the midst of the transition now, transferring files and knowledge over to the very capable team at [Race Day Events](https://racedayevents.com/). It feels really good. Good because I know that Race Day Events is a first-class operation, and good because it feels like the events and timing operation have finally grown up, and are leaving the nest - off to grow even more. 

I imagine this feeling is a little like what it’ll feel like when my little girls are ready to go off to college. A bittersweet moment. Ready to watch them grow and mature, but sad not to have them at the dinner table every night. 

I’m learning what my new role is, and learning to let go. It’s a challenge. But it’s a challenge that comes with new opportunity.
