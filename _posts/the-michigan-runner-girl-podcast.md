Heather Durocher, a Traverse City-based journalist and health and wellness writer, founded [MichiganRunnerGirl.com](http://MichiganRunnerGirl.com) back in 2010. She's been hosting a podcast via the site as well for the past few years. Yesterday, I had the honor for the fourth or fifth time of being a guest on the [Michigan Runner Girl Podcast](https://michiganrunnergirl.com/category/podcast-episode/).

Heather and I talked mostly about how final preparations are coming for the inaugural [IRONMAN 70.3 Traverse City](http://ironman.com/traversecity70.3) race, happening on August 25, and also a little bit about the eleventh annual [Traverse City Triathlon](https://www.enduranceevolution.com/traverse-city-triathlon/), which happens on July 28.
