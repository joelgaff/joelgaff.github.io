It seems like in today's culture there's a hack for just about everything. As David Goggins describes in [Can't Hurt Me](http://joelgaff.com/blog/cant-hurt-me-david-goggins-book), there's no shortcut to creating a tough mind. You have to do the things you don't want to do.

Period.

Essentially, you have to do the hard work. Just like you have to do lots of hard work to get physically strong, the same is true for your mind. There are no shortcuts to a calloused, strong mind.
