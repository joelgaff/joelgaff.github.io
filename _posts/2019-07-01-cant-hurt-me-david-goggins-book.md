Most of us have a pretty damn good life, but not all of us. Some of us have "average" lives, with a spouse, 2.2 kids, a house, a dog. Some of us have all we could ever want; a giant house, all the money we need, "everything". Some of us have shitty lives; not much food, a bad family environment, barely enough money.

In _[Can't Hurt Me: Master Your Mind and Defy the Odds](https://amzn.to/2xeTPPR)_, David Goggins details his journey from an absolutely awful childhood to great success later in life.

I'm only a few chapters into the book, and I'm blown away by the stories Goggins tells about his early life growing up in Buffalo, NY. He was one of us who had a shitty life in the beginning. Really shitty.

I'm listening to his book on [Audible.com](http://joelgaff.com/blog/audible-com) and highly recommend this medium, as Goggins has a podcast-like discussion with his ghostwriter, [Adam Skolnick](http://adamskolnick.com/books/cant-hurt-me), after each chapter, discussing the stories more in depth. It's a great bonus that helps the reader get even deeper into the story.
