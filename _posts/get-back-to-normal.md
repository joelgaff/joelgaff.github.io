Just over a week after welcoming our second child, all I want to do is sleep whenever possible. Even though I'm pretty tired I'm the morning after a night of baby feeding and broken sleep, this morning I chose to go out for a run after my 6:00 am feeding duty was done, rather than curling back into bed for a few morn hours. Somewhat surprisingly the run felt great, and it kind of felt like a normal pre-second child kind of day.

In the evening my wife and I decided to watch a little bit of our favorite show, [Hawaii Five-0](https://www.cbs.com/shows/hawaii_five_0/) on [YouTube TV](https://tv.youtube.com/) before hitting the lights. We didn't watch much, but it felt good to get back to doing some of the things we enjoy doing.
