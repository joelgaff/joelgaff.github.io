The bridge: a friend who introduces you to someone who eventually becomes your friend.

Over this long Memorial Day weekend my wife and I spent some time with a few friends, all of whom we met through a mutual friend, our bridge, who has since moved away. I commented to my wife about how many friends we had because of Marc, our bridge. Even though he's not around anymore (he moved away for medical school), we still hang out with lots of folks we met through him. He was an integral part of connecting us with many of our friends in Portland.

Be like Marc. Be a bridge.
