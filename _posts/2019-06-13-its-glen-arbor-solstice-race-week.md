This week I'm in Traverse City prepping for the Glen Arbor Solstice Half Marathon & 5K, happening this Saturday, June 15. I'm jamming out the final manuals for my course director, and will be packing aid station bins, first aid kits, and a box truck throughout the latter half of the week.

When my buddy and former business partner, Eric Houghton, and I came up with the half marathon course back in 2012 we were stoked to find that a lap around Big Glen Lake was a perfect 13.1 miles. We often tweak our courses year-to-year for various reasons but this is one of the few courses that is the same today as it was eight years ago.
