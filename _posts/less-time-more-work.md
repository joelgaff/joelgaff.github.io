Since becoming a father about a year and a half ago, I've found that when I have less time to work, I tend to focus the time I have better.  I've always worked better when a deadline is looming, but now that I have more family responsibilities, my work time is a bit more limited and I can't spend time at my laptop deep into the evening.

Being a [remote worker](https://basecamp.com/books/remote) much of the time, and much of that time working from home, I now have to be laser focused on how I spend my time when I'm actually working.  Surprisingly I think I've been more efficient at getting my work done in a more limited time frame, compared to how I was getting work done before when I essentially had an unlimited window if time every day.
