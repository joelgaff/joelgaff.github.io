Have you ever been stuck, not knowing what to write for your daily blog post?  Sure you have.  It happens to all writers at some point.  Here are a three simple prompts to help you get in the mood.

##### 1\. What's one thing that happened to you today (or yesterday) that out of the ordinary?

##### 2\. Look at all the books on your bookshelf.  Pick one title, modify it, and write a story about that new book

Example:

Real title: "How to shoot video that doesn't suck"

New title: How to write a blog post that doesn't suck"

##### 3\. Pick an object in your house and write about what it sees every day.

Example:

What is that little pony sculpture on your shelf thinking about all day long?
