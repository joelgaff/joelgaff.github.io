For the last 12 weeks it's been a challenge working from home. I work from a home office, and my wife, Laura, has been home on maternity leave, along with our newborn daughter, Penelope. I'm lucky to have the flexibility and freedom that working from home affords, but over the last three months there hasn't been much working. It has been a balancing act of trying to get some work done, supporting Laura, and taking care of Penelope. Definitely heavy on the last two.

We're less than eight weeks until Ironman 70.3 Traverse City, and I need to have all of my manuals completed four weeks before the race. That leaves me with less than three weeks until they're due. And, I have the [Traverse City Triathlon](https://www.enduranceevolution.com/traverse-city-triathlon/), which I also race direct, coming up on July 28.

That means that for the next few weeks I'll be comfort eating, drinking way too much coffee, and zoning out into Do Not Disturb mode as much as possible.
