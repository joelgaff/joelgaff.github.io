Remember how a few days ago I was talking about how cool I felt, that I was keeping everything together after having our second child?  All the early morning runs, getting my pushups in, managing enough sleep.

Remember that?

Well, it's still happening, for the most part. But all that thrown in with me trying to direct an [ultra-distance trail race](https://www.enduranceevolution.com/traverse-city-trail-running-festival/) from across the country means that my brain is blank when it comes time to write.  With that ultra coming up this Saturday, early mornings are reserved for more critical tasks, and writing is happening in the evenings.

But it's still happening.  That's not negotiable.
