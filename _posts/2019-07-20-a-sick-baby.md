It started with a snort. Last night.

Tonight she sniffles and gags. And doesn't sleep.

_Wa-wa-waaahhhhhh!!!_

I pick her up. She arches her back. She struggles.

Comfort. It's all I can do.

_Here, try your binky!_

She takes _it._ She sucks away.

Relief. But short lived. The runny nose runs some more.

_Wa-wa-waaahhhhhh!!!_

I comfort. It's all I can do.

Sleep. I don't expect much tonight.
