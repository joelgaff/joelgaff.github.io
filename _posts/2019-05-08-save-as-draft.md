Sometimes I have more ideas to write than I have available waking hours. This isn't to say that I have lots of ideas, but rather that I'm short on the waking hours part.

Today is the second day where my planned topic for the post ended up spiraling into an uber in depth article rather than a small thought. Because evenings are now my available time to write, about half way through my eyes started closing and I had to hit "save as draft" once again.

At least I'll have a great set of already-started posts on those rainy days when my ideas flow like concrete.
