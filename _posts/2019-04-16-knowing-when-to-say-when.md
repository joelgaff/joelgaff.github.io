As I've shared several times before, I'm a [streaker](http://joelgaff.com/blog/im-a-streaker). But sometimes you need to know when to say when, and let a streak go. Sometimes keeping the streak alive just for sake of it isn't worth it.

I haven't hit that point yet, but I've come close several times with some of my longer streaks. The good thing to know, is that if you do break a streak, that long streak you just needed doesn't just disappear. When you start up a new streak after missing a day, think of it as you've only missed one day in the last _insert streak timeframe here,_ rather than _my new streak is only one day long._
