While I like to talk about the times when I have a solid early morning routine, getting up pre-dawn, going for a run, and getting some writing done, all before the sun rises, there are periods when this just simply doesn't happen.

This is one of those times.

I have to admit that since our second daughter came along a little over three months ago, I've been doing more of my writing from bed, moments before plugging my phone in to charge for the night. It's definitely not my most inspirational hour, nor do I proof my writing as well as I should. It's the last resort, for sure.

Maybe it's noticeable. Maybe not. Either way, I want my writing to be as transparent as possible. Sometimes life is tough, and you don't have the perfect moment every morning, with a freshly brewed cup of coffee at your side, to write. That's ok.

Sometimes your perfect moment is 11:45pm, laying next to your spouse in bed, with your iPhone brightness turned down as low as it will go. That's ok, too.
