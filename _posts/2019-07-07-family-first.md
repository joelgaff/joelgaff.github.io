I've always been a head-down-get-the-shit-done kind of guy when work needs to happen. When deadlines loom, I'll pull an all day or all night, or all day and night marathon to make sure everything is done on deadline. Working these intense sessions usually meant paying less attention to everything else in my life. That's a lot harder to do when you have a spouse and kids that you care about and want/need to spend time with.

As I _try_ to keep [Do Not Disturb](http://joelgaff.com/blog/do-not-disturb) mode engaged over these next few weeks, it has become very apparent that I'll need to make sure I keep family in mind, and that these marathon work sessions likely won't work any more. That's ok by me, as this will ultimately help me keep a little more balance in life.
