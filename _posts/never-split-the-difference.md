This week's new read (listen) is [Never Split The Difference](https://amzn.to/2VJgrGK) by Chris Voss. So far there are some interesting techniques that Voss describes in the book, some of which I'm looking forward to applying. A full review may or may not come later, but for now I'll give the book a thumbs up. There are definitely a lot of war stories about Voss' experiences as a negotiator, but most of the time they're tied in to the lessons he's conveying.
