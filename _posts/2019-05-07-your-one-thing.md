I few months back I started reading [The ONE Thing](https://amzn.to/2V54Dt4). It's a great book that, in a nutshell, aims to help you find what _one_ thing you can do in a given context (at work, in your marriage, or even as big as in your life as a whole) to get better results. I'm still only about a third of the way through the book, as I've been reading it here and there on my phone while traveling, but I've already figured out what my one thing is.

Take one guess what that is...

Yep, it's sleep.

I know, I know, I've been writing an awful lot about sleep (or lack thereof) lately, but this revelation came long before my current [life chaos](http://joelgaff.com/blog/positive-momentum-in-the-face-of-chaos) started. I realized that if I slept better, and got up earlier, I could get so much more done throughout the day. [Attacking the day early](http://joelgaff.com/blog/mornings-are-a-must) and feeling well-rested throughout the day simply makes me a much more efficient, productive, and most of all, happy person.

Sure, right now I'm in the midst of a poor-sleep period, but that doesn't really bother me, because I know that once life settles down a little that I've got a great foundation to make great sleep habits happen again.

The idea is so simple that many folks may pass it off as _too_ simple. Don't worry, it is simple, and it can produce great results.
