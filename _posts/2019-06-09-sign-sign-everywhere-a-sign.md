Today in the life of this [Ironman Race Director](http://joelgaff.com/blog/you-are-an-ironman-race-director), I'm hashing out details for the signage plan for Ironman 70.3 Traverse City. Dozens of pre-event notification signs, race day signs, barricades, and hundreds (if not thousands) of cones.

I've probably got too many screens going on here, but it's great to have the touch interface of the [Surface Go](http://joelgaff.com/blog/microsoft-surface-go), and the extra real estate for the MacBookPro.
