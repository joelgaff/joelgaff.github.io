I've spent the last month or so building some pretty great habits, one small step at a time. I've been feeling great about the progress I've been making, and loving the results.

Then the unexpected happened. A few days ago my wife gave birth to our second daughter, five weeks early.  Wowza.  We were caught pretty off guard to say the least. Fortunately this was our second child, and our first is only 17 months old.  We feel pretty good about dealing with diapers, feeding, and the like.  Nonetheless, we had a little bit of chaos happening.

Fortunately, these positive habits I've been creating have made dealing with all this chaos much easier.  Today I wasn't stressed about getting a run in, I jsut did it when both mom and daughter were sleeping.  I wasn't stressed about getting my writing done, I just got up early and did it before feeding our newborn. Those 30 pushups a day I've been doing?  No problem. I snuck them in between nurses visits in my wife's hospital room.

If we would have had our baby a month and a half ago, I'm not so sure I would be as dedicated to keeping my good practices up.  But the positive momentum I've built has helped to make these good practices happen almost without even thinking about them.
