Did you know that if your car battery gets drained that you may need to use a trickle charger to recharge it, rather than by jumping it or using a fast charger?

Me neither.

Thanks to the helpful dude at O'Riley's I didn't need to return my 18-month old battery. It just needed a slow, overnight charge.
