Just a quick reminder that maintaining a regular writing habit doesn't mean that you have to write a 500 word essay every day. If you're just getting started as a writer and writing every day is your goal, build that habit first.

Write a brief, short, even micro post, every day. Hit publish, and move on to the next day. Once you feel like you've got a solid daily habit going, and only then, you can start writing more each day.

Keep it simple. Set yourself up for success.
