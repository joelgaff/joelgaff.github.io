Unlike many people, I love public speaking. I didn't always feel this way, and being a teacher for over a decade made it nearly second nature, but now I love it.  I really enjoy getting the chance to get up in front of an audience and delivering on a presentation or speech. When the situation or presentation is somewhat uncomfortable, I like it even more. And by "like", I mean like in the same way that I like going for ultra-distance runs and bike rides.  These situations are difficult, but I love physically challenging situations, and tonight I was reminded of how I love speaking challenges, too.
