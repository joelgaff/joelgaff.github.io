A few years ago I came across some little notebooks, called [Field Notes](https://fieldnotesbrand.com/), for sale at [Powell's](https://www.powells.com/) Bookstore in downtown Portland. I did a little research about the folks that made the notebooks and realized that one of the guys behind them was a fellow Traverse City native turned Portland transplant, [Aaron Draplin](http://twitter.com/draplin). Furthermore, even though I'd never met the guy, he was only a few years older than me and after reading a few pages of his [book](http://ddcbook.com/), I realized that we had a handful of mutual friends back in TC.

I love the pocket-sizedness of Field Notes and I've found myself using them on the daily. I carry one in my back pocket pretty much everywhere.

On top of being durable, uber handy notebooks, with the connection to Traverse City and Draplin, I instantly became a Field Notes fan. I even joined their [subscription](https://fieldnotesbrand.com/limited-editions) club.

There are loads of designs of the notebooks, but the most common is the standard kraft colored notebooks you can see above. They're classic and perfect for every day carry.
