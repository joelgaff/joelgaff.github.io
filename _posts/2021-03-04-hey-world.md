I've written quite a bit at [joelgaff.com](http://joelgaff.com/), but my writing has lapsed.  I still want that to be where I post my writing, but the sheer simplicity of writing here at **HEY World** is freeing.  No need to worry about formatting, no need to worry about layout.  Just write and send, and it's posted. Just like writing an [email to the world](https://hey.com/world/).Simple. Elegant. Distraction-free.
