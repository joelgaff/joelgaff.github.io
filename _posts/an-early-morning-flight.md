My wife, Laura, made very accurate observation the other day. We're in the throes of newborn-hood, and we've had lots of sleepless nights over the past month.

Laura accurately described what it feels like having a newborn in the house:

"It's like getting up early for a flight, at like 4:00 am... every day."

The grogginess never quite leaves, and you keep asking the flight attendant for more coffee, only to get to your destination still rather tired.
