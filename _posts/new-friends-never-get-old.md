No matter how old you are, it's always nice to make new friends. Whether you're just starting kindergarten or nearly 40, being accepted by others feels good.

My family and I just moved into a new neighborhood, and we've only been in our new home about two days. We've already met a handful of neighbors, received a plate of cookies, and have an offer for play dates for our daughter.  Not bad considering in the neighborhood we moved from, we barely knew any of that people that lived around us, and most definitely never did anything social with them.
