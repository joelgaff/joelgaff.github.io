Just as promised [a few days ago](http://joelgaff.com/blog/its-prime-day), I spent much of the afternoon trying to convince myself to buy something on Amazon for prime day. I did, in fact, buy a few items, but they were items I'd had sitting in my cart for the last few weeks.

All the Amazon devices (echo, echo show, kindle, etc.) had decent pricing today, but there wasn' else that jumped out and said, "Buy me". And my bank account is thankful.
