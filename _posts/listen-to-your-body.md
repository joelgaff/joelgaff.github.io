I've been on a solid [streak](http://joelgaff.com/blog/im-a-streaker) of running, cycling and strength training over the past several months. It feels great to be making constant progress, and that progress is motivating.

This week, I've been dealing with a really tight muscle in my left leg/hip area, and it has put a crimp on my training. Things have been going so well lately, and I don't want to ease up.

But, my body is saying otherwise.

And, I've learned that in these moments it's best to listen to my body, let the issue heal, and not fret about any lost progress or fitness in the meantime.

When your body (or mind) says "REST!", take some time to recover and you'll thank yourself in the long run.
