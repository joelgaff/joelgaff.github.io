Another [Endurance Evolution](http://www.enduranceevolution.com) event is in the books.

The weather was cool, bordering cold, drizzly and grey. But of all the runners out there today, I don't think I heard a single one complain about the weather. Complaining about "the hill", now that's a different story.

Overall it was a great day. No major issues on our end as race organizers, and there were plenty of smiling faces at the finish line all day.
