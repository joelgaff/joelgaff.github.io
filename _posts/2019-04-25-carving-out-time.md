I always try to keep a [positive attitude](http://joelgaff.com/blog/anything) and look for what's good in a tough situation.  Right now, things are tough.  I can't sugar coat it.  We just moved houses and had our second child. Sleep is scarce, stress is abundant, work isn't slowing down. I've been keeping my [streaks](http://joelgaff.com/blog/im-a-streaker) alive, which is keeping my mind happy, but time is definitely limited these days.

Fortunately as a result of our move, we're only about two and half miles from our older daughter's daycare. This means I can pretty easily ride or run to drop her off in the morning or pick her up in the afternoon. I've been doing more of this lately, and counting that ride or run as my workout for the day.  Today was actually the first time I ran to pick Hazel up.

It took me about 20 minutes to get there this evening. It's mostly downhill, and the stroller was empty, so it was a pretty swift outbound journey.

On the way home, with an almost entirely uphill trip, plus a 25 pound kid in the stroller, it definitely made it tougher than the first half.

My legs felt great, however, and to me there's always something motivating when my workout is actually a form of transportation.  I wasn't just going out for a run for the heck of it, this was a functional trip on two legs.

My daughter loves riding in the [BOB stroller](http://www.bobgear.com/strollers), and the trip went surprisingly quickly.  I was definitely in my upper heart rate zones, but because I was in transport mode, it wasn't so bad.

Carving out the time for a run, while combining it with something I'd have to do anyway is the icing on the cake.  It would have taken me about 20-25 minutes to make the pick up trip via car.  for an extra 20-25 minutes of time, I get a run in at the same time.  That's a good deal to me.

Hazel thought so, too.
