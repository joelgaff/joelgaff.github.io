Today's post is brought to you by the effects of not getting enough sleep. I'm enjoying writing the occasional poem on the blog, but I also have to be honest and let you know that most of these poems are written late at night, typically with at least a little hint of sleep deprivation. Hence the recurring theme of, well, sleep.

More than two hours. Sleep.

Uninterrupted. Sleep.

On my schedule. Sleep.

Close my eyes and. Sleep.

It's time to feed again? Sleep.
