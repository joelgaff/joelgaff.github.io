I've been a runner for over 25 years now. I've never liked listening to music while running. I always hated the headphone cords flopping around, and ear buds tugging at the cords every time I turned my head to look around. Plus, subconsciously I always tried to sync my stride rate with the cadence of whatever I was listening to. Not always ideal, and always annoying.

Enter Apple AirPods. Finally the wires were gone. I had a great reason to listen to music while running. Oh, but that dang cadence problem. But what about listening to someone tell a story, or some people having a conversation? What about...podcasts!

Wait, is this 2005? Podcasts? Really?

Yes podcasts, yes really.

About five months ago I started listening to some of my favorite podcasts like the [Rich Roll Podcast](https://www.richroll.com/category/podcast/), [How I Built This](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510313/how-i-built-this), and [Rework](https://rework.fm/) on my runs, and it has been a game changer. I even listened to an entire audiobook over a few runs.

I still run occasionally without listening to anything, but listening to great stories really makes the miles fly by.
