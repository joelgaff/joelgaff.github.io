Call time for our staff on race day on Sunday was 4:00 am for a 6:00am race start. The entire crew worked their butts off straight until after 8:00 pm, and we had a great event.

I walked over 31,000 steps (nearly 13 miles), loaded and unloaded trash from a 24' box truck, pulled course signs, and so much more in between.

Helping out at this event was a fantastic way to get to understand the inner workings of a 70.3 event, and I feel much more confident heading in to The Traverse City event in a few months.
