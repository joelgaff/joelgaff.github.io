I rarely use the [TriggerPoint Nano Foot Roller](https://amzn.to/2lrOxxx) to massage my feet. I use it almost exclusively to roll out my chronically tight piriformis and glutes. It's the perfect width to hit both piriformi at once, or I can shift my weight a little bit to reeeally dig into one side. I sit down on it like it's a foam roller.

I like this roller better than a lacrosse ball because it isolates the massage in one plane or direction. With a lacrosse ball (or any other similar ball massager) I find it hard to really dig in and keep the ball rolling in a straight line, mostly because I'm wincing in pain.

It's a perfect size for travel, too. It's only a little bigger than a 12oz can. This little bugger is my go-to roller these days.
