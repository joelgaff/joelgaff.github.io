A few months ago I started a free trial on [Audible.com](https://www.audible.com/). Somehow I accidentally forgot to cancel before the trial period was over and all of a sudden received an email that said "your new Audible credit is here!" or something like that (on Audible, buying a book costs one credit).

Listening to books has proven to be a great way to "read" more in the midst of my busy everyday life. I've plowed through two books in the past few months almost exclusively listening while I run. I definitely miss the ability to quickly stop and reread a passage. It did also take a little getting used to listening versus reading and I wish the audio books came with a digital version to read along with, or refer back to. However, in the end Audible, has proven to be a highly effective way for me to read more books.
