Such are the thoughts of a tired father.  As you may notice if you're reading other posts on my website, live with a second little one around the house has caused a (hopefully temporary) lack of sleep and general life chaos. My brain fries more easily, my thoughts aren't as sharp, and did I mention tiredness?

Here's a quick glimpse of part of my every day right now. I call it Snork.

Rrrrrrr-uuh!

Mmmmm-eehhhh!

Hick! Hwooop!

Ehh! Ehh! Ehhhhhhhhhh!

Snork! Aaaaaaahh!

Says the little one from the crib across the room.

My eyes are still heavy. My thoughts are slow. My breathing deep. It's almost time to feed again. She's waking up. I just want to sleep.
