Jet lag and kid lag has been real the last few days. It also seems like I just can't get anything done during the day when the little one is awake most of the time and my wife needs help around the house. So, I've reverted back to my night owl ways out of necessity.

This afternoon and evening I've accomplished more desk work than I have in the past week or so. The only problem is that I'm exhausted and have to tend to the baby throughout the night. At least work is done.
