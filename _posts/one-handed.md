Upon becoming a parent, there are lots of new skills you have to learn.  How to change a diaper, how to burp a baby, and how to warm up (and not overheat) a bottle of formula or breast milk are just a few.

However, you still have to go about the rest of your day, doing all the other things you normally did pre-kid, such as making dinner, sending emails, taking the dog for a walk, and so on.  But now, as a parent, you're more than likely going to have to do more than one of these at the same time.  Which leads me to the parenting axiom #48612:
