As I mentioned yesterday, I'm in Traverse City and it's [Glen Arbor Solstice](https://www.enduranceevolution.com/glen-arbor-solstice-half-marathon-5k/) race week. But these days I'm always working on [Ironman 70.3 Traverse City](http://joelgaff.com/blog/the-ironman-operations-trifecta)stuff, too. This week is no exception.

Tonight (Tuesday) was filled with two township board meetings, and tomorrow morning is a road commission meeting. We're getting ever closer to getting all the final official approvals for the event. Finally.
